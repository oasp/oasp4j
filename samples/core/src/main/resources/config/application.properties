# This is the spring boot configuration file for development. It will not be included into the application.
# In order to set specific configurations in a regular installed environment create an according file
# config/application.properties in the server. If you are deploying the application to a servlet container as untouched
# WAR file you can locate this config folder in ${CATALINA_BASE}/lib. If you want to deploy multiple applications to
# the same container (not recommended by default) you need to ensure the WARs are extracted in webapps folder and locate
# the config folder inside the WEB-INF/classes folder of the webapplication.
