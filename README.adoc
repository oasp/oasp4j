= The Open Application Standard Platform for Java

[NOTE]
===============================
*OASP has been superseded by devonfw*, the Open Source Standard Software Development Platform for state of the art Cloud Native Micro Service and Multi Platform Rich Web Apps, supported by Capgemini.

See http://devonfw.com and on Github http://github.com/devonfw

Individual products within OASP have been renamed to a corresponding one in devonfw. 

For example:

- OASP4j -> devon4j
- OASP4js -> devon4ng
- OASP4NET -> devon4NET

devonfw® is an exclusive and registered (European Trademark) product of Capgemini. Capgemini reserves all intellectual and industrial property rights over devonfw but publishes it under the Apache License, Version 2 – like OASP-  which makes devonfw 100% Open Source.
