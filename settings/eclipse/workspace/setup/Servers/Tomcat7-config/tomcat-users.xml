  <!-- 
    ATTENTION: 
    This is a very simple approach that we are using to keep the sample application simple.
    In reality never ever store passwords unencrypted and/or in flat files. Also never ever even
    think about implementing your own user/password store. There are many implicit demands like
    salting and hashing passwords, expiry of passwords, notification for expiring passwords,
    password renewal, rest in case of lost passwords, central password policies, etc.
    In a real enterprise scenario use an access manager for the central identity management and for
    authentication.
    
    NOTE: 
    We do not keep the roles here as JAAS and Servlet API does not allow to retrieve the roles
    of an arbitrary user in a portable or even in any way. However, for our business scenario we 
    have demands for this.
    We try our best in using and relying on Java/JEE standards but in this case the standards are 
    so poor that there is no other way.
